### Design Pattern

**MVVM Pattern**
MVVM offers two-way binding between view and view-model. It makes use of the  observer pattern to make changes in view model
- Model: stores data + related logic (interacts with DB)
- View: standard UI components + pages
- View-Model: functions, commands, methods to support state of Views
